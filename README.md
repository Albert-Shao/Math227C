# Math 227C: Stochastic modeling and statistical modeling for the life sciences

We will edit this live in class!

* The repository will be updated throughout the course, including with lecture notes. A convenient way to rapidly synchronize a copy onto your computer is using git, available openly online.
* In the second part of the course, we will make use of Jupyter notebooks and the R programming language. The easiest way to install Jupyter and R on your machine is through Anaconda, available openly online. We plan to start using Jupyter around the 5th week of class.

## Premise

This course follows MATH 227A and 227B in establishing mathematical and computational tools useful in modeling the dynamics of biological systems. This course, MATH 227C, is in two parts: the first covers stochastic processes, where randomness plays a role in the system behavior; the second covers statistical modeling, where models, including their attributes such as parameters, are learned from data in the presence of noise or inherent randomness in the model.
